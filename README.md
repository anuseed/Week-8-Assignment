# Workflow planning

- Basic template with nav links and content
  done
- Routes (static, dynamic)
  done
- Displaying the data from the db
  done
- Sending data to the db
  done

# Still to do

- add metadata
  done
  would have liked to add the name of the destination to the url rather than the id not sure where this would be done
- add delete button to comments rather than post
  done
- styling
  very basic using tailwind
- stretch add categories to destination
  left this one
  -- still need to sort post by asc and desc --- finding this a bit tricky as only know how to do so in the client
  - add a link to got back to destinations or add destination when user submits comment
